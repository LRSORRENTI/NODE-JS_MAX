==========
CSRF TOTAL
==========

We saw in the last lecture how to add CSRF tokens 
to an individual getIndex method inside of 
shop.js controller, but adding that CSRF field 
for every method everywhere is a bit cumbersome 

We want to tell Express.js that have data that needs 
to be present in every rendered view 

app.js:

app.use(csrfProtection)

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.session.user) {
    return next();
  }
  User.findById(req.session.user._id)
    .then(user => {
      req.user = user;
      next();
    })
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
});

// After we get the user, but before the routes
// is where we'll use CSRF 

app.use(req, res, next){
  res.locals.isAuthenticated = req.session.isLoggedIn;
  res.locals.csrfToken = req.csrfToken();
  next();
}
