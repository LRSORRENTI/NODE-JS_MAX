==========
ENCRYPTION
==========

We saw in the last lecture how to extract email and 
password from the signup page, and store it inside of 
mongoDB, but there's a big problem, it's in plain text

We need to implement an an ENCRYPTION technique to 
safely store passwords, we can use a package called 
bcrpytjs

in the terminal run: npm install --save bcryptjs 

Then in the auth Controller we can use bcrpytjs
