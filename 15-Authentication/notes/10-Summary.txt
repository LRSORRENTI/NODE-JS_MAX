Module Summary
==============

In this module, we learned about the basics of 
authentication: 

- Authentication means that not every user 
  has the ability to view and interact with 
  everything

- Authentication has to happen server-side and 
  builds on sessions

- We can protect routes by checkeing the 
  session-controlled login status before 
  accessing a controller action

Security and UX: 

- Passwords should be stored in a hashed form

- CSRF attacks are a real issue and web apps must 
  include CSRF protection! 

- For better UX, include ways of flashing error 
  messages that can be displayed in views
