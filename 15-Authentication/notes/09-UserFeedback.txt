=======================
Providing User Feedback
=======================

There's a problem we have right now, 
if we want to pass in data into the rendered view 
if we're redirecting 

We also learned that if we need to share data across 
requests, we need a session

We'll use a session, but we don't want to store 
error messages for the end user inside permanently

We can implement a way to show the error message, 
then remove it from the session, so for any 
requests made after, that error message is not 
present

For this we'll use another package to help 
streamline this process

npm install --save connect-flash

And connect-flash is simple to use, back inside 
of app.js
