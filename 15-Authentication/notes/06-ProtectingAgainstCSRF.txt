=======================
Protecting against CSRF
=======================

So we'll install a package called csurf

npm install --save csurf 

This package will allow us to generate a CSRF 
token, which is a string value we'll embed 
into our forms, for every request that 
changes the users state 

Like ordering something, or anything sensitive 

Then on the server, this package will check if 
that request does have a valid token

This means that the fake sites can send requests, 
but none of those requests will have a valid token

And guessing the token isn't feasible, as it's a 
random hashed value, and only one value is valid 

And a new token is generated for every page that's 
rendered
