=========================
Serving Images Statically
=========================

How can we ensure our images are served to the client?

Option 1: We serve all public client images in a 
static way, this means we go to app.js

And look at this line: 

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

We can serve more than one folder statically 

STATIC MEANS REQUESTS TO FILES INSIDE THAT FOLDER 
WILL BE HANDLED AUTHMATICALLY, AND ALL THE FILES 
WILL BE RETURNED 

Express static method does all the heavy lifting 
for us 

So we can duplicate: 

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

And also statically serve the images folder 

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'iamges')));
