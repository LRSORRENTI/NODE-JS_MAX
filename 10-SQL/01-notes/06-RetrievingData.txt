=============================
RETRIEVING DATA FROM MYSQL DB 
=============================

In the previous lecture we added one dummy row 
in our products table, that has an id,title,  price, 
description, imageURL 

And we added inside of app.js: 

const db = require('./util/database.js')

db.execute('SELECT * FROM products').then().catch()

promise method chaining 

They will execute on whatever the SQL syntax returns 

A promise is a JS object, not specific to node, 
it's also available in the browser 

This enables us to work with ASYNC code, 
instead of using callbacks, which we could 
use, but promises allow us to write more 
structured code we can also write it like: 

db.execute('SELECT * FROM products')
.then( (result) => {console.log(result)})
.catch( (err) => {console.log(err)})

This is clean when we have ASYNC tasks to complete
