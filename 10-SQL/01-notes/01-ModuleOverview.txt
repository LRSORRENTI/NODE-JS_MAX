MODULE OVERVIEW
===============

In this module we need to learn about how 
we store the data we need inside of a database 

This is a more real-world way, storing all data 
inside of a local json file is not really how 
things work in an actual developer environment 

Most companies or large scale projects will utilize 
databases to house data 

We'll first go over two popular database structures, 
SQL and NoSQL

But first we'll learn SQL, and set up a MySQL 
database
