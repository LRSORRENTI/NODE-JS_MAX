==================================
Inserting Data Into MySQL Database
==================================

Now let's learn how we can insert data 
from our app into our database, 
in admin.js controller we have the method 
we use to create a new product: 

exports.postAddProduct = (req, res, next) => {
  const title = req.body.title;
  const imageUrl = req.body.imageUrl;
  const price = req.body.price;
  const description = req.body.description;
  const product = new Product(null, title, imageUrl, description, price);
  product.save();
  res.redirect('/');
};

Essentially we want to leave this code as is, but 
make one tiny change
