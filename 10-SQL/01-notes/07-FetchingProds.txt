FETCHING PRODUCTS
=================

Now that we successfully connected to the 
mySQL database from our app.js, we'll start 
actually working with MySQL 

So we'll remove the:

 db.execute('SELECT * FROM products')
.then( (result) => {console.log(result)})
.catch( (err) => {console.log(err)})

from app.js, and instead go back into our models 
directory
