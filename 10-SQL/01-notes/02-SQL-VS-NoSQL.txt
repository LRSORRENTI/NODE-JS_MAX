============
SQL VS NoSQL
============

SQL or NoSQL, that is the question.

To make an informed decision, we need to 
learn the differences, the strengths and 
weaknesses of both to determine which we 
want to stick with for our use case 

We we'll be learning both, then once we've 
had some practice with both, choose which 
one you think is best for the project

The goal is to store data, and make it 
easy to access, that's why we utilize 
databases, it enables much faster access 
than having to work with a file especially 
as the data inside grows 

In a file, we'd need to read the entire file just 
to locate a single slice of data we need 

In this course we'll be learning the two 
most popular, SQL: mySQL and NoSQL: MongoDB

============
What is SQL?
============

SQL works with tables, maybe we have a USERS, 
PRODUCTS and ORDERS tables

In each table we have fields and columns, for 
users they might have id's, emails, names 

For products maybe it has id's, title, price, and 
description

And we fill in data by adding them as rows, and 
columns 

One benefit of tables in SQL is they can be related: 

For Ex, an order table could be a connection of 
user and product 

These are known as 'relations' is SQL based 
databases

=================================
CORE SQL DATABASE CHARACTERISTICS
=================================

- Data Schema (id, name, age) -> all data in a table 
  must fit the schema! 

- Data Relations - We related the tables in our 
  SQL database with these three: 
    - One-To-One 
    - One-To-Many
    - Many-To-Many

  Tables are connected!

===========
SQL QUERIES
===========

Queries are command we use to interact with the 
SQL database: 

SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 28

This command will select all users over 
the age of 28

The uppercase are special keywords to structure 
the command

And the lowercase (*, users, age > 28) represent the 
parameters of the command
