Setting up MySQL
================

MySQL is one of the most popular SQL databases, 
and it's free! 

We're going to use the free MySQL Community Server, 
and we'll also need the MySQL Workbench, both 
free downloads can be found at: 

https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

If you're using windows you can use the MySQL 
installer for Windows download link, which will 
streamline the installation process, installing 
separately works fine but this way will save time! 

Okay I ran through the setup process, and set up a new 
schema for node, I think it's working, but a caveat 
here is I'm using a mucher newer version of this 
than Max, hopefully the core fundamentals of 
learning aren't hampered by differing versions
