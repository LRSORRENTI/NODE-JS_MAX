Using POSTMAN For API Tests
===========================

We'll use POSTMAN for testing

POSTMAN has a gui desktop app that allows for 
localhost tests, the online UI doesn't allow localhost 

Then inside of the app, in workspaces click new, or + 
then for this test click POST request, and fill in 

localhost:8080/feed/post 

then below click body, then select raw dropdown and 
JSON, then inside:

{
    "title":"Title from POSTMAN desktop app",
    "content": "testing from POSTMAN"
}

Then press send, now you'll see below postman returns: 

201 Created 158ms 395 B

{
    "message": "Post created successfully",
    "post": {
        "id": "2023-08-03T13:38:41.566Z",
        "title": "Title from POSTMAN desktop app",
        "content": "testing from POSTMAN"
    }
}

POSTMAN is a very popular tool when working with 
REST API's
