Module Summary
==============

That's the basics of REST API's, we'll dive much 
deeper in the next core module, actually building 
a full REST API 

But we went over the core concepts this module: 

=====================
REST CONCEPTS / IDEAS
=====================

- REST APIs are all about data, no UI logic is 
  exchanged 

- REST API's are normal node servers which expose 
  end-points (HTTP Methods and a path) for clients 
  to send requests to 

- JSON is the common data format that's used, but 
  sometimes you'll see other data formats like XML 

- REST API's are de-coupled from the clients that use 
  them, we specify the end-points and the data they 
  should expect 

======================
Requests and Responses
======================

- Attach data in JSON format and let the end know 
  by setting the 'Content-Type' header: 

postButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      title: 'A codepen post',
      content: 'Created in codepen'
    }),
    headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
  })

- CORS Errors occur when using an API that doesn't 
  set those CORS headers: 

      res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');

    // We could pass in codepen.io above if we wanted 
    // to just allow codepen, but we use * for all instead 

    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE');

    // We can also modify which methods to allow, we could ,
    // only allow GET or POST, whatever we need 
    
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization' );
