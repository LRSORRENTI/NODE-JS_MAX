====================================
REST API's, Clients, and CORS Errors
====================================

Let's test something, on codepen we'll add 
two buttons, getButton and postButton, 
and we'll register event listeners for 
click events which will make a request to our 
backend 

And we'll use the fetch API which is a built in 
browser API we can use to access our endpoint:

const getButton = document.getElementById('get')

const postButton = document.getElementById('post')


getButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    fetch('http://localhost:8080/feed/posts') 
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(resData => console.log(resData))
    .catch(err => console.log(err))
});

And if we click get posts button we see Cross Origin 
Error

By default CORS is not allowed, we can't share resources 
across differing origins 

We can fix this, if we want to offer data to different 
origin clients, we often serve things from different 
servers, that don't share the exact origin 

We need to enable CORS 

To tell the browser we need to change something on 
our server, inside of app.js we need to set 
some headers in a general middleware

    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization' );

And we set these headers before we send the response 

Now when we press the get button we see: 

{posts: Array(1)}
posts: 
Array(1)
0
: 
{title: 'First Post', content: 'this is my first post'}
length
: 
1
[[Prototype]]
: 
Array(0)
[[Prototype]]
: 
Object


But we need to change some things in our postButton, 
we need to set the body to JSON stringify, as well 
as setting the headers to content-type json:


const postButton = document.getElementById('post')

postButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // we change the path from posts to post, since
  // we're now targeting the post method in 
  // the routes feed.js file 
  fetch('http://localhost:8080/feed/post', {
    // And we pass an object as a second arg
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      title: 'A codepen post',
      content: 'Created in codepen'
    }),
    headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
  })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(resData => console.log(resData))
    .catch(err => console.log(err))
  
});


//clicked: 
{message: 'Post created successfully', post: {â€¦}}
message
: 
"Post created successfully"
post
: 
content
: 
"Created in codepen"
id
: 
(2) [Array(2), 'UTC']
title
: 
"A codepen post"
[[Prototype]]
: 
Object
[[Prototype]]
: 
Object

Also important to note inside of app.js: 

    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization' );

    If we commented that out, everything breaks, 
     we need to allow the control to 
     authorize content-type setting 

There are other ways of send ASYNC requests, like 
AJAX and AXIOS, and if it's a mobile app on 
Apple / Android, it will be totally different
