==================
Modern JS and Node
==================

Back when node was first created, JavaScript 
didn't have the same amount of features it does 
now 

So core node js is missing some of those new features,
node, but node now has acceess to both 
ES Modules, and Promises within core node API's like 
the filesystem api node ships with, which are 
traditionally callback based 

But what are ES Modules? 

In this course we've primarily worked with the 
require() syntax, but we can utilize ES Modules for 
a cleaner import/export syntax:

One file can have: export const doSomething(){...};

Then it can be imported with: import { doSomething } from 'filename.js'
