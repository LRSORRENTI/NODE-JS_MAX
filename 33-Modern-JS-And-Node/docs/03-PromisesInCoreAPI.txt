=========================
Promises in core node API
=========================

So far in the course, we used a callback 
based approach when utilizing things like 
readFile

Node, when it was first introduced, preceded 
promises and other async methods, it was 
callback based 

And on the official docs, we see that there's 
a fs.Promises API 

And we can use them by importing them: 

import fs from 'fs/promises'
