WHAT IS NODE.JS?
================

WELL NODE JS IS A JAVASCRIPT RUNTIME,
AND JS IS MOST COMMONLY USED IN THE BROWSER 
TO CREATE DYNAMIC WEBSITES

BUT JS IS NOT LIMITED TO THE BROWSER, NODE.JS 
IS BUILT ON JAVASCRIPT, IT TAKES JS AND PUTS 
IT INTO A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT

IT ALLOWS JS CODE TO RUN ON THE SERVER, OR 
ANYWHERE ELSE REALLY, LIKE NORMAL PROGRAMMING 
LANGUAGES THAT AREN'T SHACKLED TO THE BROWSER 

===================
HOW DOES THIS WORK?
===================

WELL NODE.JS USES V8 JAVASCRIPT ENGINE
BUILT BY GOOGLE, THAT RUNS JS IN THE BROWSER 

SO V8 IS AN ENGINE, AND V8 TAKES JS AND 
COMPILES INTO MACHINE CODE

===========
REPL
===========

A REPL is an interactive programming environment
 that allows you to execute code snippets
  or statements and immediately see their results.

With a Node.js REPL,
 you can quickly test out code, 
 experiment with new ideas,
  or debug issues by executing code
   one line at a time.

To start a Node.js REPL, 
you can simply type node 
into your terminal and press enter. 

This will open up the REPL prompt, 
where you can start typing in JavaScript code.
