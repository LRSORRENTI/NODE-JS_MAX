In this course we follow the request / response 
cycle 

Client makes a request, server takes that request,
and returns a response 

But what if something changes server-side, and 
we want to inform the client of that change? 

We can use websockets instead of HTTP

Websockets establish via HTTP, with a 'handshake'

Websockets use a defined protocol which determines how 
the communications occur 

With HTTP it's request / reponse 

With Websockets it's push data, and request / response 

Websockets push data from server to client without 
the need for the request 

Typically you'll utilize both HTTP and Websockets
together in a node app
