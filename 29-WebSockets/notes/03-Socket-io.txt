Socket.io 
=========

Socket.io is a package that uses websockets and 
provides a lot of convenience features around 
that protocol 

It streamlines the prcess of setting up a channel 
between client and server

Socket.io is just one package that helps utilize 
websockets, but it's not required, there are other 
ways of implementing websockets without utilizing 
Socket.io 

We'll need to add socket.io on both the front and 
backend of our application, client and server 
will communicate through websockets, we need 
to establish that communications channel on both 
ends 

npm install --save socket.io

And on the frontend: 

npm install --save socket.io-client
