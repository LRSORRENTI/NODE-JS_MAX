Pagination - Fetching Data in Chunks
====================================

Let's think about how we're working with our 
MongoDB, right now we fetch all products when 
displaying the page 

We can instead use Pagination to split our data 
across multiple pages 

This is something that's usually done when working 
with large data sets 

Often with modern websites, they have limits for 
products per page, they have a pre-set number 
of products per page, sometimes you can have 
the user specify how many products to display 

Often times there's pagination, page 1, 2, 3.. 
and the user can jump from page to page by clicking 
the pagination links for the different pages
