===========================
MVC (Multi-View Controller)
===========================

This module focuses on a vital aspect of structuring 
and building web apps, backend apps like the one 
we're building

We need to follow a pattern to structure our 
code, how we logically separate our code and 
how all of it's core functionality ties together 

We'll dive into the MVC pattern now, how it's used, 
why it's useful, and implement it in our online 
shop project we've been slowly building over 
the last few core modules
