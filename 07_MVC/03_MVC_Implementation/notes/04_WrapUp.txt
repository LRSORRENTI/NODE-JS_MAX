MODULE SUMMARY
==============

That is the MVC pattern implemented

--------
 MODEL 
--------

- Responsible for representing the data itself

- Responsible for managing that data(save, fetch etc..)

- Can be managed from memory, files, or databases 

- Contains all data-related logic 


-------
 View 
-------

- What the end user actually sees on their end 

- Shouldn't contain too much logic (EJS, handlbars!)

----------
Controller
----------

- Connecting the model and the view together 

- Should only ensure the model and view can 
  communicate in either direction
