Storing data inside of files using models
=========================================

Let's start saving our data inside of files rather 
than inside of a single array 

To do this we first need to work with the 
file system, remember from the beginning of the 
course? 

const fs = require('fs')

Now we can use all the fs methods like writeFileSync

And that file should be created in a path to ensure 
we make a path accessible by all OS's 

const path = require('path')

const products = [];

module.exports = class Product {
    constructor(t){
       this.title = t;
    };
   
   save(){
      products.push(this)
   };
   static fetchAll(){
     return products;
   };
};
