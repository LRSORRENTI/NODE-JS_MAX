=======================
Advanced Authentication
=======================

In this module we'll learn: 

- Resetting Passwords 

- Authorization


We can improve our authentication workflow, 
and in general improve overall security of our app 

We'll also ensure that only users who've created 
a post, are able to edit it 

Resetting passwords is a common functionality across 
web applications 

People forget passwords, they need a way of resetting 
them 

To implement this we'll need to add a new view
and some new routes
