============================
Implementing the token logic
============================

We want to implement a way to enter an 
email address to the reset password field 
then receive an email with a link to allow 
the resetting of a password 

For this we need to first create a unique token, 
a token with an expiration date, and we need 
to store it inside of our database 

That way, the link that's clicked includes 
that token so we can verify it with the token 
stored in the database 

Node.js has a built in crypto library we can 
use 

at the top of the auth.js controller: 

const crypto = require('crypto');
