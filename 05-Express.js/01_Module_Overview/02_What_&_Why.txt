==============================
Why do we need Express anyway?
==============================

Writing every single component of 
our server side logic is complex

Remember in the last module we had 
to manually listen for the 'data' event,
'end' event then create a buffer, then covert 
to a string:

`````````````````````````````````````````````````

  if (url === '/message' && method === 'POST') {
    const body = [];
    req.on('data', chunk => {
      console.log(chunk);
      body.push(chunk);
    });
    return req.on('end', () => {
      const parsedBody = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
      const message = parsedBody.split('=')[1];
      fs.writeFile('message.txt', message, err => {
        res.statusCode = 302;
        res.setHeader('Location', '/');
        return res.end();
      });
    });
  }
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');

  `````````````````````````````````````````````````

  But what if the data we get is a file, or 
  data that's not structured in a way we expect, then 
  we would need to write new logic ourselves to 
  handle such a task 

  EXPRESS itself doesn't do this, but it allows for 
  another package to be easily hooked into our 
  project which then will do the parsing 

  Express allows us to focus on the business logic, 
  not the nitty-gritty details 

  Express provides helper functions, tools and rules
  that help streamline the development process, use 
  express as a tool do perform the heavy lifting!

  =======================
  ALTERNATIVES TO EXPRESS
  =======================

  - Vanilla node.js, we can always write these tools 
    for our app ourselves, this is one approach 

  - Adonis.js, Adonis is another web framework similar 
    to Laravel if you've used PHP 

  - Koa, developed by the same team behind express, 
    Koa provides more modern approaches to handling 
    web framework logic 

  - Sails.js, another web app framework built on node.js,
    this follows the MVC pattern, and is often preferred 
    for API first development approaches, Sails.js is 
    considered to have a steeper learning curve than 
    Express, Adonis, and Koa

   - And many more! 

   =====================
   WHY WE'LL USE EXPRESS
   =====================

   The reason why we'll use express in this course is 
   because express is widely used, highly flexible, 
   doesn't add too much bloat out of the box, and it's 
   extremely extensible, there are thousands of libraries 
   and packages for Express.js!
