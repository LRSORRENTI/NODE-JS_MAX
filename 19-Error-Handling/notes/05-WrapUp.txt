Module Summary
==============

In this module we had a look at different types 
of errors and how to handle them: 

We differentiate between types of errors, 
technical errors(thrown), and expected errors 
(invalid user input data)

Error handling can be done with custom if checks, 
try-catch blocks, then catch blocks 

Express offers built in middleware error 
handling helpers 

======================
Error and Status codes
======================

It's good practice when returning responses, 
to also set HTTP status codes, letting the 
browser know what went wrong 

Success codes (2xx)

Client-Side Errors (3xx)

Server-Side Errors (5xx)

Setting status codes doesn't mean the response is 
incomplete or the app crashed!
