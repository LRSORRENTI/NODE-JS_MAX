===================
NODE MODULES SYSTEM
===================

Let's wrap this node basics module up, and 
we'll start by modularizing our old app.js from 
tbe previous sections 

Typically we work with multiple files, so let's create 
a new file to house our routing logic

So in the routes.js file, at the bottom we added 
module.exports = requestHandler

but if we wanted to export more we could do: 

module.exports = { 
    handler: requestHandler,
    someText: 'Hello World' 
}

or alternatively the following also works: 

module.exports.handler = requestHandler;
module.exports.someText = 'Hello World';

I think the module.exports = {} is cleaner 

That is how to export multiple things from a given file 
but back in app.js we need to change:

const server = http.createServer(routes);

to: 

const server = http.createServer(routes.handler);
