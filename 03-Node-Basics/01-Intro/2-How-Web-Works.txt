How does the web work?
======================

The user or client side (browser) visiting 
a webpage, so you're entering a URL (uniform 
resource locator) into your browser

Then the browser reaches out to some Domain 
Name Servers to look that domain name up, because 
a name like: https://my-page.com is not 
the exact address of the server, it's just a 
human readable version of that address 

So then the browser sends a request to that 
address belonging to that domain (10.212.212.12)

This is where node comes into play, we write the 
code that handles functionality on that server, or 
ip address (10.212.212.12)

Keep in mind node.js isn't the only way to do this, you 
could use PHP, ASP.net, Ruby on Rails etc.. 

Typically on this server you might reach out to your 
database 

And you also send back a response to the client, which 
can be HTML text, but it could also be JSON data, or 
other types of files like XML

A request and response also have headers, which is 
meta-info attached to the requests and responses 
describing the contents of each respectively

This is how the web generally works, and we'll be using 
Node.js to illustrate these concepts throughout the 
course

These requests and responses are done through 
some protocol, typically HTTP or HTTPS, this are 
sets of rules governing the data and what 
the data must look like 

HTTPS is the same as HTTP except it includes SSL or 
Secure Socket Layer which encrypts the data

Since in this course we'll only be working locally, 
we'll primarily be using HTTP, but we'll thoroughly 
go over implementing HTTPS as well 

This is how the web works in a nutshell
