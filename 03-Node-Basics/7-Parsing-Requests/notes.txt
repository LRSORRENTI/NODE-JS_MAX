================
Parsing Requests
================

We want to extract the data passed into the 
input field after the send button is pressed 

How does this work? 

In node.js there are streams of data, and a concept 
known as: 

===================
STREAMS AND BUFFERS
===================

Example: Incoming Request

When we have a request, it's read by node in 
chunks, in multiple parts along the stream: 

Request body part 1 ------> Request body part 2 -------> 
Request body part 3 ------> Request body part 4 ------->
Fully parsed 

This is done so we can work on individual chunks without 
having to wait for the full request to be read 

Now for a simple request like the one we've seen, this 
isn't really required, we only have one field of input 
data

But think about a file being uploaded, it could be 
a very large file, therefore streaming that data 
could make logistical sense because it could enable 
writing to the disk or hard drive where the app runs 
on the node server while the data is coming in 

That way we don't need to parse the entire file 
which does take time, and then needing to wait for 
 the upload to finish before doing anything with it 

 Now in order to be able to work with these chunks of 
 data, we need to use what's known as a BUFFER 

 ======
 BUFFER
 ======

 A buffer is like a bus stop, buses are always transporting 
 but they also pick up passengers at the bus stops, 
 and that is what a buffer is 

 A buffer is a bus stop that allows us to work with 
 the stream of data, or a  bus going along it's route, 
so we can work with chunks of data before they are released 

Let's see how this works in practice
