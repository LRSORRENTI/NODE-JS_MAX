Mongoose - What is it?
======================

Mongoose is to MongoDB what Sequelize was 
to mySQL

Mongoose has a similar purpose to Sequelize, 
it wants to enable you to have an easier time 
working with the data, and now having to worry 
about the queries quite as much 


Mongoose is commonly referred to as
an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library 
for MongoDB, it does exhibit some similarities
to ORMs in terms of its functionality
and the way it interacts with the database.

Mongoose provides a mapping layer between
JavaScript objects and MongoDB
documents, allowing you to define schemas,
create models, perform CRUD operations,
and define relationships between data.
  
These features are similar to what you would 
find in an ORM. However, since MongoDB 
is a NoSQL database, and Mongoose is 
specifically designed for MongoDB, 
it is more accurate to classify it as 
an ODM rather than an ORM.

So, while the term "ORM" is typically 
associated with SQL databases, Mongoose 
behaves in a similar manner by 
abstracting away some of the database-related 
complexities and providing a more object-oriented 
way to work with MongoDB.
