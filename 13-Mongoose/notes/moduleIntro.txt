Mongoose - What is it?
======================

Mongoose is to MongoDB what Sequelize was 
to mySQL

Mongoose has a similar purpose to Sequelize, 
it wants to enable you to have an easier time 
working with the data, and now having to worry 
about the queries quite as much 


Mongoose is commonly referred to as
an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library 
for MongoDB, it does exhibit some similarities
to ORMs in terms of its functionality
and the way it interacts with the database.

Mongoose provides a mapping layer between
JavaScript objects and MongoDB
documents, allowing you to define schemas,
create models, perform CRUD operations,
and define relationships between data.
  
These features are similar to what you would 
find in an ORM. However, since MongoDB 
is a NoSQL database, and Mongoose is 
specifically designed for MongoDB, 
it is more accurate to classify it as 
an ODM rather than an ORM.

So, while the term "ORM" is typically 
associated with SQL databases, Mongoose 
behaves in a similar manner by 
abstracting away some of the database-related 
complexities and providing a more object-oriented 
way to work with MongoDB.

===============================
The main idea remains the same: 
===============================

We have data, let's say a user document: 

User: name, age, email, password 

And we want to save that user data into a collection,
we want to map that data

So the user object could be mapped like: 

id: 1
name: "Luke"
age: 28
email: mongoose123@mongoose.com
password: wasda123

And we could hard write the query which would 
look like: 

db.collection('users').insertOne(
    { name: 'Luke', 
      age: 28,
      email: mongoose123@mongoose.com,
      password: wasda123
    }
)

But the ODM approach is more akin to: 

const user = User.create({
    name: 'Luke', 
    age: 28,
    email: mongoose123@mongoose.com,
    password: wasda123
})

Mongoose let's us define the models, and it 
will take care of the queries for us behind 
the scenes 

We can always modify the queries if needed but 
mongoose will make life easier when working 
with MongoDB

Core Concepts
=============

Schemas and models ----> eg. User, Product

Instantiations --------->  const user = new User()

Queries ----------------> User.find()
