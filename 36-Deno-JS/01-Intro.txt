Deno JS - An alternative to Node
================================

Deno, an anagram of the work Node, 
was created as an alternative to Node 

It's similar to Node, it also utilizes JS, 
but there are some key differences 

In this module we'll go over what it is. why 
it exists and when you may want to switch to Deno 
over Node 

=============
What is Deno?
=============

Deno is a runtime based on Chromes V8 JavaScript 
Engine, the same engine Node uses 

Deno allows you to run JS outside of the browser

One key difference is Node needs to compile all TypeScript
into JavaScript before executing, Deno doesn't, 
Deno can execute TypeScript without needing to 
first turn it into JavaScript

=====================
Why was Deno created?
=====================

Deno was created as a quest to make a better Node.js 

Deno supports many new JS features out of the box, 
comes with more security enhancements

Ryan Dahl wasn't satisfied with many aspects of 
Node, and wanted to create something better, 
and more featured than Node
