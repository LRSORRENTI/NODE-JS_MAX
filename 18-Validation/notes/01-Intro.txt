Validating user input is a critical feature 
we need to implement

In this Module we'll learn why this is important 
and how we can implement it effectively 

We validate the data is correct, ensuring it's in the 
format we expect it to be

Why Validate? 

If we have a user, maybe we have some forms, 
like signing in, signing up, resetting credentials

And when we submit these forms, we send requests 
to the backend, a request with the form data is sent 

And on the backend we have a ways to interact with 
databases and files 

But we take that input field and store it, 
and this is why validation is critical, what 
if the end user tries to input a malicious script 
into our input field? 

We need to validate that the input field contains 
data in the format we want, not just any kind of 
input data 

Then if the data is in the format we need, 
we allow things to move on and be handled

Or we reject the input where we redirect a 
message prompting the user to correct the error
