How to implement validation
===========================

We can validate client side, with 
the help of JavaScript before any request is sent 

We can write JS code that watches the key events 
on the input form, then checks the input while 
the user is typing and display an error, we 
can change the DOM on the fly in the browser before 
anything is submitted 

This can enhance user experience, but since it's 
client side the user can interact with and change 
that code 

It's not a secure solution, this technique is for 
user experience only 

It's why we validate server side, since the user can't 
see this code, can't change this code, this 
is a must have, and is what we'll focus on 

MongoDb and other databases also offer built-in 
validation
