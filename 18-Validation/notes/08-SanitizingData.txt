Sanitizing Data
===============

Often times we need to sanitize user input data, 
what does this mean? 

On the valdidator docs, we also see sanitizers, 
sanitizers have methods that will trim whitespace,
ensure that a users email is converted to lowercase 

We can do this by chaining another method on our 
router.post('/login') route: 

router.post('/login', [
  body('email')
  .isEmail()
  .withMessage('Please enter a valid email address')
  .normalizeEmail(),
  body('password', 'Password must be valid')
  .isLength({ min: 5 })
  .isAlphanumeric()
  .trim()
],

authController.postLogin
);

We can call the normalizeEmail() method, as we;; as 
.trim() to trim any whitespace

We can also add these sanitizers to the other 
input fields for password and email on the 
postSignup route
