===================
Building a REST API 
===================

How do we start building a REST API? 

Well we need a node express server just like before, 
also there are dedicated REST API frameworks you 
can look up, but we'll use express 

1. npm install --save express 

We need express to build our API 

2. npm install --save-dev nodemon

We'll use nodemon again so we don't need to 
refresh, and in the package json add a start
script: nodemon app.js

3. npm install --save body-parser

4. Create a routes folder, and inside create a 
   feed.js file, for maybe a blog site or a message 
   feed
