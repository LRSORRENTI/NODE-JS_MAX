Testing Node Apps
=================

So far in the course we've manually tested our node 
app, but the downside to this approach is that it's 
easy to forget to test, or test too little 

Maybe a new feature introduces unforeseen cascading 
changes elsewhere in the application that causes 
some problems 

This is where Automated Testing comes into play, 
where we write code that tests the app, we 
define scenarios to test our app, and these tests 
can run after every change

The advantage of Automated Testing is we can 
test core features of the app after every change

The thing to keep in mind however, we need to ensure 
we test the right things, there's no point setting 
up tests for scenarios that are not even in the 
code, or testing for the wrong thing 

And automated tests are only what we define, 
a user may run into a problem in the UI, a 
situation we didn't test for
