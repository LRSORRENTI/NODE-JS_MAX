Why And How To Test 
===================

Automated tests are defined by us, 
and we can configure them to test after 
every new feature or code adjustment

Makes it easier to detect breaking 
changes that maybe aren't expected 

The tools and setup we'll use are going to 
use automated tests 

We need a tool to execute the test code, which returns 
an output of which tests have passed / failed 

The second tool is one that allow us to define 
the conditions which must always be met, we asset 
certain results 

We'll use Mocha and Chai for testing in this module, 
Jest is another popular testing tool 

But for managing side effects and external 
dependencies we'll use a tool called Sinan
