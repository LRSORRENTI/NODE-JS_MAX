==========
SSL / TLS
==========

We always need to protect data, especially if 
we have any sensitive information 

We can use SSL and TLS to assist with the 
protection 

Once SSL / TLS is in place, eavesdropping on 
information becomes much more difficult

To enable SSL / TLS, we work with a public / 
private key pair, we only ever use and expose 
the private key to us, on the server, only we 
should have access to the private key

The public key howwever is exposed, this is for 
encrypting, that can only be decrypted by a matching 
private key, they are a pair, and the corresponding 
private key can decrypt
