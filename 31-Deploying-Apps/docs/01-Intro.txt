=========================
Deploying Apps To The Web
=========================

NOTE: MAX MOVES BACK TO MVC PATTERN FOR 
THE REMAINDER OF THE COURSE 

In this module we'll learn best practices for 
configuring and deploying apps to the web, preparing 
for deployment and security

And so far in this course we've built 
apps using MVC where we have server rendered views 
using both vanilla HTML and templating engines 
like EJS, PUG, and HANDLEBARS 

We also ditched the MVC pattern for REST API data 
interpolation, as well as graphql API's 

But do these types of apps need to have different 
deployment configurations? 

Keep in mind how the app behaves, requests, and 
data acceptance / returns are code we wrote, but 
in both we use node, and express 

So in turn we have similar hosting requirements for 
both types of apps, so when we move our code to a web
server, we do the same thing, we spool up our 
node server, and wait for incoming requests 

Therefore we don't need to config differently for 
MVC vs REST vs graphql
