Deployment Prep
===============

To prepare for deploymen, one thing we'll 
add, which I already added, are environment 
variables, the .env files which contain data 
that shouldn't be freely available, like API keys 

We also need to sanitize the error messages, 
we don't want to offer sensitive error  info to 
potential bad actors 

It's fine to use detailed errors in development, but 
when we actually push an app to production, we need 
to review those error objects 

We also need to set secure response headers, learn 
how and why to set them 

Asset compression, adding sone ways to reduce response 
size improves overall app performance since the client 
requires few download amounts 

Configure logging, since we're not testing the server, 
but we have end users, we want to log interactions 
to be up to date on what's happening 

Using SSL, TLS, where data is encrpyted in transit

The last three points, asset compression, logging, 
and SSL / TLS are often handled by the hosting 
provider
