What is MongoDB?
================

Well mongo is the name 
of the company, and DB is for 
data base. 

Mongo is derived from huMONGOus
as in humongous database, because 
it can store huge quanitities of 
data 

MongoDB is capable of dealing with 
gigantic datasets, and is very 
popular in the database world 

In MongoDB there are no schemas like 
SQL databses, we can have any kind of data 
structured however we like 

Often you'll end up with a similar structure, 
but you're not forced into one like in SQL

A document in MongoDB looks like: 

JSON (BSON) DATA FORMAT:

{
    "name": "Luke",
    "age": 29,
    "address": {
        "state": "Wisconsin",
        "city": "Fond Du Lac",
    },
    "hobbies": [
        {"name": "Running"},
        {"name": "Golf"}
    ]
}

It looks very similar to JSON doesn't it 

Every single document you store must look like 
the above, or similar for MongoDB, it follows 
the JSON format, to be precise it uses 
What is BSON? BSON is a binary encoded 
Javascript Object Notation (JSON)

Such a JSON document is essentially the same 
as a JS Object, nested or embedded documents, 
arrays that hold multiple documents, strings, 
numbers etc.. 

There's great flexibility in MongoDB, this 
also means relations are managed a little 
differently in the MongoDB world
