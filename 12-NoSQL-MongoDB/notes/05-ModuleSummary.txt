Module Summary
==============

In this module we learned about NoSQL databases, 
specifically MongoDB 

- Alternative to SQL databases 

- No strict schemas 

- Reference based relations are viable.
  but there's more flexibility

- Relations are often created by 
  embedding documents / data 

====================
Working with MongoDB
====================

- Use the official MongoDB driver 

- Commands like insertOne(), find(), 
  updateOne(), and deleteOne() make CRUD 
  operations simple

- Check the MongoDB docs for a more in depth 
  guide on available operations and configuration
  operators 

- All operations are promise-based .then(), .catch(),
  and you can easily chain these methods for more 
  involved control flows
