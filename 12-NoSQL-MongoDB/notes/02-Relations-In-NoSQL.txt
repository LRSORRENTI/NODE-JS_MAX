==================
Relations in NoSQL
==================

In NoSQL it's normal to have collections 
that may have duplicate data, in an embedded 
in another document, in a different collection 

These are how relations are formed, we can 
take the information that's needed from another 
document, and copy that into the place you need 

Then we have that data ready to go, it enables 
the user to query data in the format needed without 
any trouble 

There's not a need to do a lot of merging, you 
can grab the data you need without the need to 
merge multiple collections behind the scenes 
on the server 

That being said, you can still do that if needed: 

===================
Relations - Options
===================

- Nested / Embedded Documents: 

- References 

There's no schema, no structure required, 
and we have fewer data relations
