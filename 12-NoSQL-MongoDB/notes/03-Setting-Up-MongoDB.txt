==================
Setting up MongoDB
================== 

We'll set up MongoDB Cloud Atlas, it's free,
all you need to do is create a free account 
and you're good to go 

After logging into MongoDB, we need to 
create a new cluster, choose the free option 
which is M0 

You can change the cluster name, then press 
create cluster 

=============================
Installing the MongoDB Driver
============================= 

Next we also need to connect using 
a driver and version, first we install in 
our app: 

npm install mongodb 

Then add the connection string: 

mongodb+srv://username:<password>@clustername.mppqkhv.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
