=============
PRODUCT MODEL
=============

Now that we've added controllers, we 
need to add the product model 

We have a products array below, and a product 
is created on the fly as an object that looks like:
  products.push({ title: req.body.title });
  
In the end that product we push into the products array 
represents our data, so let's add a model for that 
data, inside the root dir create a new directory called 
models 

const products = [];

exports.getAddPRoduct = (req, res, next) => {
    res.render('add-product', {
      pageTitle: 'Add Product',
      path: '/admin/add-product',
      formsCSS: true,
      productCSS: true,
      activeAddProduct: true
    });
  };

  exports.postAddProduct = (req, res, next) => {
    products.push({ title: req.body.title });
    res.redirect('/');
  };

  exports.getProducts = (req, res, next) => {
    res.render('shop', {
      prods: products,
      pageTitle: 'Shop',
      path: '/',
      hasProducts: products.length > 0,
      activeShop: true,
      productCSS: true
    });
  }

  Later on in the course we'll use a real database 
   for grabbing data, rather than using local arrays
