=================
ENHANCING OUR APP
=================

In this module we'll move more in the 
direction of a realistic online shop

We'll add more controllers and views, 
as well as clean things up a bit in the 
project structure 

And let's think about this app, in the end we 
want an online shop application 

What we need is a home page or landing page

A products page to peruse and browse available 
products 

Have admin capabilities for deleting and 
modifying the products on our site

We want to allow for products to be saved 
to a shopping cart

We need a checkout page for payment 

And an orders / profile page for a user
