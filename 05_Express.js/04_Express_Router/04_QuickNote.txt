QUICK NOTE
==========

In the next lecture, we'll write this code:

module.exports = path.dirname(process.mainModule.filename);

(I explain why we write this code in the next 
lecture when we write it!)

The important thing is that you
 might get a deprecation warning 
 for that code - in that case, you can 
 simply switch to this code:

module.exports = path.dirname(require.main.filename);
Quite straightforward :D

ALSO with our routes: 

router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../', 'views', 'shop.html'))
})

we can change the second argument in path.join from 
'../' to just '..' that way we don't assume the 
OS path if it's '/' or '\' 

router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'views', 'shop.html'))
})

We also can make it even easier with a helper function

Let's create a new folder called utils, where we'll 
add a path.js file
