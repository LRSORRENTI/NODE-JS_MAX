===================
CREATING HTML PAGES
===================

Now that we've went over routes, and how to 
filter paths using middleware, let's actually go 
over what to serve to the end user

Thus far we've just res.send(dummy HTML tags)

and not real fleshed out HTML content, so let's 
practice returning actual index.html files to the 
end user 

Let's create a new folder called views, we'll call 
it this because towards the end of this project we'll 
build a Multi-View-Controller or MVC, one component
of an MVC is what we serve to the end user in 
the views folder, for now the views folder will house 
html files
