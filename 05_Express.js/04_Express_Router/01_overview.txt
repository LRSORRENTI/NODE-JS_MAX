EXPRESS ROUTER
==============

We've been learning about Express, 
it's benefits and how we can utilize 
app.use, app.post, and app.get, and we've 
been using all of these inside 
of one main app.js file but typically 
in the real world, we split our routing code 
into separate files

So maybe we have our post request logic in one file, 
and an app.use in another then we import / export 
that logic for use in our project, rather than 
inside one gigantic app.js file

But this is where Express Router comes into play, 
router gifts us with nice functionality for 
routing into other files 

========================
ADDING OUR ROUTES FOLDER
========================

We're going to create a new folder in our 
main directory called 'routes' this is where we're 
going to house all of our routing files, files that 
will execute for different paths and HTTP methods 

The first file we'll create in our routes folder will 
be admin.js, we'll also add a file called shop.js
