GETTING STARTED
===============

Step one is to run npm init -y, 
then we also need nodemon saved as a 
dev dependency again, npm install --save-dev nodemon 

Now let's install EXPRESS! 

npm install --save express 

Why --save flag and not --save-dev? 

Because express is not going to 
just be used during development like nodemon, 
express will ship with our application

Now we see Express is a package in our dependencies 
in the package.json, and we can start using it! 

Let's go back to our app.js file and get started!
