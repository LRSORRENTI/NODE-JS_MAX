=======================================
EXPRESS.JS IS ALL ABOUT THE MIDDLEWARE!
=======================================

Here's a diagram illustrating what express 
is doing for us: 

Incoming REQUEST -> MIDDLEWARE(next() function, 
but the logic behind next() is:
 (req, res, next) => {...})

MIDDLEWARE -> res.send() (the res.send() logic 
is: (req, res, next) => {...})

MIDDLEWARE -> RESPONSE 

RESPONSE -> 

So when we get an incoming request, it's funneled 
through functions within Express.js

Instead of having a single request handle, we instead 
have hooking in multiple functions, which the request 
will go through, until we send the response

This allows for blocking out our code so that we 
don't have one single gigantic function responsible 
for everything

This is the 'pluggable' nature of Express.js 

Where we can easily add third party packages, which 
can give middleware functions, that can be plugged 
into Express.js and add functionality
