Course Outline
====================

Here's a brief overview of the course's 
structure, and the general path through 
Node.js we'll be taking: 

Section-1: JavaScript Refresher --- This 
section will be mostly review for you, it 
will not be a comprehensive or wholly complete 
section covering every nuance of JS, it will serve 
as a JS warmup or refresher before we get into the 
full Node.js course 

Section-2: Node.js Basics --- This will 
be an intro to the basics of Node.js, how 
it functions, how to work with streams of data, 
some core Node.js modules, key details on Node.js


Section-3: Efficient Development --- Debugging, 
handling errors, and general best practices in Node 
Development

Section-4: Express.js --- Express is the most 
popular framework for Node.js, it represents the 
'E' in MERN, MEAN, and MEVN stack Development for 
React.js, Angular.js and Vue.js respectively. We'll 
learn why we use Express.js, and the details of Express

Section-5: Templating Engines --- These are tools 
used to generate HTML pages on the server with DYNAMIC
content within them. 

Section-6: MVC or Model-View-Controller --- What 
this MVC pattern is, and why we use it, and how to 
use it Efficiently

Section-7: Advanced Routing and Models --- Routing 
is something we'll also cover in the Express section-4, 
but we'll dive much deeper in this section on the models 
of the MVC pattern

Section-8: Node + SQL/MySQL --- This sections we'll 
learn how to connect a node app with a SQL database, 
if your not 100% familiar with SQL it's ok, it will 
be a useful overview of how to connect to them efficiently 
even if you've never worked with SQL 

Section-9: Sequelize --- This is a package that 
makes working with SQL easier 

Section-10: Node + NoSQL databases --- This 
will go over connecting to relational databases 
like MongoDB

Section-11: Mongoose --- Using Mongoose to 
make working with Node and MongoDB easier, at this 
point we'll be sticking with NoSQL for the remainder 
of the course 

Section-12: Sessions and Cookies ---
