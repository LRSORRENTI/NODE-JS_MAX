=========================================
Understanding the Role & Usage of Node.js
=========================================

Node.js is how we run server side code,
things like databases, authentication, 
input validation, business logic

In the browser a user might go to your 
website, which makes a request, then the 
server sends the response HTML page, 
but we never want sensitve info to be stored 
and accessible in the browser

===========================
A side note
===========================

Node.js is not limited to 
a server, it's a runtime, 
we can execute any JS code 

We often use it for local 
utility scripts, and 
build tools

If you've ever used React or Angular,
and had scripts like 
npm run build or any run scripts, 
that is node

========================
Node.js role in web dev 
=========================

Run Server - Create server and listen to 
incoming requests 

Business Logic - Handle requests, validate 
inputs, connect to databases 

Responses - Return responses, rendered HTML, JSON etc..
