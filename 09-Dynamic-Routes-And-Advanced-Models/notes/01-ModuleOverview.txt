==================================
Dynamic Routes and Advanced Models
==================================

In the previous module, we enhanced the 
structure of our online shop, we 
added sub-folders to house all 
related views, as well as updated the routes 
to create a more streamline and maintainable / 
extensible application.

Now we need to try and utilize the features of 
Dynamic Routes and Advanced Models to 
dynamically pass in data on the fly to our 
application, this is how real world apps function, 
when you log in to a website, your saved info, 
cart info, wishlist, all of that data is loaded 
into the browswer dynamically, you don't need 
to re-save things to your cart everytime you log 
in, that data is saved, and dynamically rendered 
client side for you! 

We need to encode some information so we can pass 
around product id's as part of the URL, this 
module we'll learn how to structure and send data 
via URL, when it's ideal to perform this, and when 
not to.

We'll also improve the structure of our models: 

What we'll learn: 

- Passing Route Parameters 

- Utilizing Query Parameters

- Use those Parameters to enhance the 
  models in our shop application
