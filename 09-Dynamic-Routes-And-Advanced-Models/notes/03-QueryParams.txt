==================
USING QUERY PARAMS
==================
 
 Now we've worked on the cart model, but 
 we still need implememnt the view for the 
 cart as well as the delete functionality 

 But first we need to learn about query parameters 

 Inside of edit-product.ejs, we want to render the 
 products available to edit, or the ones we want to 
 edit 

 But since we'll be utilizing the same ejs template 
 for edit-product, we can re-use the entire template 
 for edit-product 

 And query parameters look like in the url: 

 \admin\edit-product\12345\?edit=true 

 we can also use & 

 \admin\edit-product\12345\?edit=true&title=new

 We check for these query params inside the 
 controllers 

so for 

exports.getEditProduct = (req, res, next) => {
  const editMode = req.query.edit;
  if(!editMode){
    res.redirect('/');
  }
  res.render('admin/edit-product', {
    pageTitle: 'Add Product',
    path: '/admin/add-product',
    editing: editMode
  });
};

if the url for editmode is true or "true", the 
extracted valye is always a string, so "true"

If we don't find it, it will be undefined which 
is false in a boolean check

These are often used for tracking users, or keeping 
a filter for something set on a page
