MODULE SUMMARY 
==============

In this module we learned: 

- Dynamic Routing 

  - We pass dynamic path segments by 
    adding a ':' to the express router 
    path 
  
  - The name after the ':' is the name 
    to extract data on req.params 

  - Optional (query) params can also 
    be passed (?param=valye&b=2) and 
    extracted with (req.query.myParam)  

- Worked more with Models 
 
    - We added a Cart model, to house 
    static methods only 
    
    - Interact between models (e.g. delete a 
        cart item if a product is deleted)
    
    - Work with files for data storage is suboptimal
      for large datasets
