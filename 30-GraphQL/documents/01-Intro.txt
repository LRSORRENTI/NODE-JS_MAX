Intro to GRAPHQL
================

GraphQL is an alternative to building a REST API,
and is used in the same kinds of scenarios as 
REST 

Just like with REST, where we ditched the MVC pattern, 
in GRAPHQL, we also won't be rendering views, or 
working with templating engines like PUG or EJS 

GRAPHQL is also a de-coupled just like REST was 

In this module we'll learn: 

- What GRAPHQL is and why it's used 

- GRAPHQL VS REST API 

- How to use GRAPHQL
