Module Summary
==============

We've successfully changed our RESTFUL API into 
a graphql API

We learned some core concepts about graphql: 

- Stateless, client independent API 

- Higher flexibility than REST API's due to 
  custom query language that's exposed to the client 

- Queries are used to mutate and manage data in 
  all the ways REST API's can, we only send POST requests 
  and define the schemas ourselves 

- All graphql requests are directed to a single endpoint: 
  POST/graphql

- The server parses that incoming query expression,
  and calls the appropriate defined resolver 

- Graphql can be implemented in any frontend, not 
  just React.js like we used in this course

Graphql VS REST 
===============

REST API's are still very useful: 

- REST is great for static data requirements like 
  file upload, scenarios where data is needed all the 
  time 

- Graphql does provide more flexibility by exposing 
  an entire query language, vs all the different 
  possible REST API endpoint configurations
