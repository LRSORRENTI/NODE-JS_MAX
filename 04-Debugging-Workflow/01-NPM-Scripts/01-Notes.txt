If we look in the package json file: 

{
  "name": "01-npm-scripts",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Debugging workflow, Max's Node.js Course",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Luke Sorrenti",
  "license": "ISC"
}

We see there's a scripts section, with one 
default script, but let's add another below: 

 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node app.js"
  }

  Now that we added a script to run app.js, that 
  way we don't need to type node app.js everytime,
  we just enter: npm start, and it's the equivalent 

  This is good when working with others, that way 
  they can look in the package json to see which 
  file is the entry file for the app 

  We can add any scripts we want to our package json
  the only caveat is that the name "test" or "start" 
  can never have any whitespace, so if we had a long 
  script name it would need to be "start-my-server" 
  or "add-x-y-z" just no whitespace

IMPORTANT TO NOTE HOWEVER, WITH CUSTOM SCRIPTS, THEY 
MUST BE ENTERED PREFIXED WITH 'run':

npm run add-x-y-z 

or 

npm run start-my-server
