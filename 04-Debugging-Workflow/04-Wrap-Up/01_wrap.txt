==============================================
WRAP UP FOR DEBUGGING AND DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
==============================================

Now let's wrap this section up with a recap: 

We started with NPM, which allows us to manage 
our project, and facilitates ease of use for 
dependencies, it also added a package.json, where 
we can add custom scripts 

We initialize it with: npm init 

And npm scripts can be defined in the 
package.json file to give shortcuts 
for common tasks and commands in your app

====================
THIRD PARTY PACKAGES
====================

We also utilize npm for third party packages 
because node.js projects usually don't exclusively 
use core modules, but also third party packages 

We install them with npm 

And we can differentiate them between 
production dependencies(--save) and developer 
dependencies(--save-dev) in the package json, as well 
as global dependencies(-g)
