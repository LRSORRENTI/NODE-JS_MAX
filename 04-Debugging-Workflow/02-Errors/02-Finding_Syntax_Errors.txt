FINDING AND FIXING SYNTAX ERRORS
================================

For example: 

cons server = http.createServer(routes.handler);

VSCODE will underline 'cons' with the error: 
';' expected, this is because VSCODE thinks 
cons is a variable name

But if we leave it, and just try to run npm 
start, we see a different error in the terminal:

SyntaxError: Unexpected Identifier
cons server 

It doesn't explicitly state we need to add 't' to 
our variable, we can still infer that the error 
is stemming from that line specifically 

VSCODE will show a red bar in the right slider 
for different errors, press the red bar to jump to 
the error 

If we forget to add an ending '}', VSCODE 
will return the error '}' expected, this 
means we need to check all of our blocks to 
see where we forgot to close with the '}'

Utilizing the IDE to help traverse and locate 
errors will help enable better error location
