A good example for this is the 
res.write method: 

res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html')
    res.write('<html>')
    res.write('<head><title>My First Page With Node</title></head>')
    res.write('<body><h1>Hello World From Node.js Server</h1></body>')
    res.write('</html>')
   return res.end();

If we omit the 'return' keyword from the 
final line above, the code will continue to 
execute, let's change it to just:

res.end();

In the terminal there's an error: 

_http_outgoing.js:470
throw new ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT('set');

Error: Cannot set headers after they are send to the 
client

This error is telling us, the way we've structured 
our code, we tried to set the headers after they've 
already been sent, so that's a good hint to check 
the code block where we're sending those headers. 

We know see that once we prefix the return keyword
to res.end(),
