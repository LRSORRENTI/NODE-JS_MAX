UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT ERROR TYPES
===================================

Having a solid foundation on how to 
define and solve an error, which there 
will always be, errors are a part of 
programming

How do we dissect and identify the error? 

We first need to understand that errors are 
not one of a kind, there are different types: 

===============
TYPES OF ERRORS
===============

1. Syntax Errors: These errors are due to typo's in 
   your code, missing brackets, unclosed parens etc..

2. Runtime Errors: These are errors that aren't 
   typos, but code that breaks when executing

3. Logical Errors: These can be tricky to properly 
   identify and diagnose, as we may never see any 
   error message, the code will simply not function 
   in the manner it should

But like many things in programming, we have tools 
that can help us diagnose and repair all types of 
errors
