Sending Emails
==============

This module will focus on how we can send 
emails from our node app 

Sending emails is an essential task in modern 
web applications 

A good example is when a user successfully signs up, 
sending them a confirmation email is standard 
practice everywhere 

How does this work? 

Well we have our node server, and an end user, 
and we want to send an email to that user 

But with node, it's not easy to trivially create 
a dedicated mailing server 

Handling mails is different than handling req, res 
cycles, it's a totally different setup 

Therefore in reality, you'll likely never hard code 
build your own unique mailing server, it's a complex 
task, creating a mailing server that is capable of 
sending thousands, tens of thousands of emails 
simultaneously, and doing it securely 
is way beyond the scope of this course 

Which is why we continue our trend of using 
third party packages, and in this case a 
third party mail server 

Many large web apps, including Udemy, don't have 
an in house mail server team, they outsource 
it to a dedicated third party service 

And for learning purposes we'll use a service 
called SendGrid
