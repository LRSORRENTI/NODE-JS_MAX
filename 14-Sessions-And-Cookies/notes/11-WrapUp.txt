In this modules we learned about cookies: 

Cookies are: 

- Great for storing data on the client side 

- Don't store any sensitive data here, as it 
  can be easily viewed and manipulated

- Cookies can be configured to expire when the 
  browser is closed or when an expiry date is 
  reached

- Works well along with sessions


We also learned about sessions: 

- Stored on the server, not the client

- Great for storing sensitive data that must 
  persist across requests 

- Anything can be stored inside sessions !

- Often used for authentication purposes

- Identified via Cookie, which is different than 
  'Session Cookie' 

- Possible to use different storage techniques for 
  saving sessions on the server
