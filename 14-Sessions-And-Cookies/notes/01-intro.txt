====================
Sessions and Cookies
====================

Let's explore some mechanisms for storing 
data in memory, and the client side 

We'll go in depth into what cookies and 
sessions are, why they are used, and how 
they are used together 

=================
What is a cookie?
=================

If we have a user on the client side, and a 
server where our node app lives, the user 
interacts with the front-end views we have 
rendering 

And from that view maybe we have an input field, 
when the user submits we send a request to our 
node server, let's say this request needs us to store 
some kind of data in the browser

If the user logs in successfully, we need a way 
to remember that the user is logged in, so 
if the user refreshes the page, it doesn't ask 
them to log in again

So we can send back a cookie, user submits login, 
login is successful, we send back a response, 
which could be a new view, but we also include 
our cookie

And that cookie is important for storing that info 
that the user is validly logged in, and we 
can store that information in the browser

Cookies are stored on the client side!

We're going to create a dummy login page, and 
there'll be a complete module focusing on 
authentication

We'll create a new route that will navigate to 
/login
