Configuring Cookies
===================

We learned cookies can be easily manipulated, 
so storing sensitive data inside of a cookie is 
not something we're going to want to do 

But for tracking users, cookies can be useful

We can also add addtional values to our cookie: 

exports.postLogin = (req, res, next) => {
    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'loggedIn=true; Max-Age=3600')
    // with Max-Age=3600  our cookie 
    //will expire after 3600 seconds, or 1 hour
    res.redirect('/');
}

exports.postLogin = (req, res, next) => {
    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'loggedIn=true; Max-Age=3600'; Secure)
    // We can also set Secure as a value, meaning the 
    // page will only be served via HTTPS not HTTP
    res.redirect('/');
}

exports.postLogin = (req, res, next) => {
    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'loggedIn=true; HttpOnly')
    // we can also add HttpOnly, which protects us from 
    // malicious scripting attacks, or XSS attacks 
    // with the HttpOnly value, we can't access the cookie 
    // client side, the cookie value cannot be read client side 
    // We'll learn more about this in the authentication
    // module
    res.redirect('/');
}

Often we won't directly set cookies ourself, we 
typically utilize well tested authentication packages 
which will assist us in managing cookies
