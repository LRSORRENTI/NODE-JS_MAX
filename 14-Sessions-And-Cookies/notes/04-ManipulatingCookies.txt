Manipulating Cookies
====================

In the last section we learned how to set 
a cookie, as well as how we extract the 
true value from it 

There are also third party packages available
that make handling cookies easier, but the way we 
extracted the value works  

BUT THERE'S A BIG FLAW

Inside of the dev tools we can easily just change 
the cookie Value from true to false 

That's the rub, we can manipulate it from inside 
the browser, and we don't want the users of our website 
to log in by Manipulating a cookie value

That leads to an important point, sensitive data 
should never be accessible inside the browser, 
since users can access and edit it

That's where Sessions can assist us
