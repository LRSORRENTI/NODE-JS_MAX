================
Setting a Cookie
================

We learned that after the req res cycle, 
the req.isLogged: true, doesn't persist 

Which is not ideal, making users log back 
in constantly

That's what cookies will assist us with, 
a cookie will store data, for one user, in 
the client browser just for them 

This personal cookie will have no effect 
on any other logged in users on our site, 
since they all will have unique cookies 

The job of the cookie is to say: 'I am already 
logged in, and authenticated' 

So how do we set a cookie? 

Well we start by adding a header: 
  

  exports.postLogin = (req, res, next) => {

    // We set the header in our response,
// and we pass in 'Set-Cookie'
    // this 'Set-Cookie' is reserved, it's 
    // a special phrase which... sets a cookie!

    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'loggedIn=true' );

    // and the second arg is the value of the header, 
    // which is a key value pair

    res.redirect('/');
}
// And yes, if we look at the dev tools, 
// and in the application tab, scroll down 
// to cookies, we see our cookie!

// Name: loggedIn
// Value: true

// And now that our cookie is set, the browser 
// sends it to the server for every request that's 
// now made 

// and now let's click on the products link, 
// which takes us to the product page, then 
// look at the network tab in dev tools, 
// we see the 200 ok  GET request, 
// and if we scroll down to request 
// headers, we see our cookie!! loggedIn=true
