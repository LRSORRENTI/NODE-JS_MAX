Setting a Cookie
================

We learned that after the req res cycle, 
the req.isLogged: true, doesn't persist 

Which is not ideal, making users log back 
in constantly

That's what cookies will assist us with, 
a cookie will store data, for one user, in 
the client browser just for them 

This personal cookie will have no effect 
on any other logged in users on our site, 
since they all will have unique cookies 

The job of the cookie is to say: 'I am already 
logged in, and authenticated'
