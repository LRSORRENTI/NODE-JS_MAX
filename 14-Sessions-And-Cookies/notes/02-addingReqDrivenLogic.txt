===============================
Adding the Request Driven Logic
===============================

Now that we've added the basic login route, 
and added a little styling to it, we'll not 
implement authentication right now, we'll 
have an entire module, but we'll take a dive into
sessions and cookies!

Let's say when the user presses 'login' button
we'll send a request to the backend form, which 
is what we stored in auth login, we send a POST 
request to /login 

In a real scenario, we'd need to validate email 
and password, which we'll look at later, but for 
learning purposes in this module we'll assume 
the input is valid
