Using MongoDB to store sessions
===============================

The problem we have right now is that our sessions 
are stored in memory, and memory is not infinite 

So for learning purposes it's okay but for a real 
application it wouldn't be viable 

If we have 100,000 or more users, our memory would 
very quickly overflow

And from a security perspective it's also not ideal 

So we want to store our sessions, and if we look at the 
express-session package docs, we see all kinds of 
stores are supported, like 

connect-mysql-session, connect-session-firebase, 
dynamoDB-store, and of course:

 connect-mongodb-session 

 so inside the terminal enter: 

 npm install --save connect-mongodb-session 

 And to setup our new store functionality
 back inside of app.js we bring in the 
 package 

 const MongoDBStore = require('connect-mongodb-session')

But we also want to pass in session as an argument like 
this: 

const session = require('express-session')
const MongoDBStore = require('connect-mongodb-session')(session)
