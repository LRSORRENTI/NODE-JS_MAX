====================
Sessions and Cookies
====================

That's the nice thing with sessions, we 
can take cookies used to identify users, and 
store them server side, which is much safer 

Remember the 

app.use(session({secret: 'my secret',
                resave: false,
                saveUninitialized: false,
                store: store
              }));

session middleware automatically sets a cookie 
but you can pass in cookie related info: 

app.use(session({secret: 'my secret',
                resave: false,
                saveUninitialized: false,
                store: store, 
                cookie: {
                    
                }
              }));
