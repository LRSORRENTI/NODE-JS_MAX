=====================================
REST API's and the Rest of the Course
=====================================

Before we dive in, let's take a second to reflect 
on what we've learned and implented thus far. 

We learned: 

- Node / Express.js App Setup 

- Routing / Endpoints 

- Req / Res Handling 

- Validation

- Database Implementation

- Files, Upload, Download 

- Sessions and Cookies 

- Authentication

These are imporant topics we learned, how do these 
come into play now that we've ditched the 'View' 
based application, and are instead utilizing 
a REST approach? 

- Node / Express.js App Setup 
  This doesn't change at all really, we still 
  use Node and Express for our app 

- Routing / Endpoints 
  This doesn't change much either, we have a few
  more HTTP methods now 

- Req / Res Handling 
  This does change, instead of Views, we parse + send 
  JSON data 

- Validation
  This won't change much, we'll still use Express-Validator 
  package

- Database Implementation
  This also won't change much, we'll still use MongoDB 
  and mongoose 

- Files, Upload, Download 
  For server side, nothing changes, but client side 
  we'll change the upload / download structure a bit

- Sessions and Cookies
   This is a big change, with REST API's we won't be 
   using Sessions and Cookies, the reason for this is 
   because with REST, every request is treated uniquely, 
   from previous requests, no connection from client / server 
   We manage no sessions because the REST API doesn't care 
   about the clients 

- Authentication
  This will also change, we'll implement a different 
  approach via JSON WEB TOKENS (JWT)
