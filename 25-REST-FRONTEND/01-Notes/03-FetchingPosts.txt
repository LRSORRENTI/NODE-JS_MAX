As a note here, we're spooling up our REST-API 
in the folder 24-REST-API on port 8080 

And inside of 25-BUILD-RESTAPI we're spooling up 
our React frontend on port 3000

This setup simulates that these two parts of the 
application are served separately by different 
servers, a common scenario since front end apps 
can be served on static hosts 

We have different ports now, therefore different 
domains
