Updating Posts
==============

To implement functionality for updating posts, 
we need to add an HTTP put method inside of our feed.js 
routes: 

router.put('/post/:postId')

but we also need a new controller action to pass 
as a second arg to .put, so in controllers/feed.js:

exports.updatePost = (req, res, next ) => {
    const postId = req.params.postId;
    const title = req.body.title;
    const content = req.body.content;
    let imageUrl = req.body.imageUrl;

    // but if the image url isn't just text in 
    // the request body, but a file instead,
    // we need to handle that scenario:

    if(req.file){
        imageUrl = req.file.path;
    }
    // So here if imageUrl IS NOT set, because 
    //    let imageUrl = req.body.imageUrl; wasn't 
    // able to be extracted, and we didn't make it 
    // into the conditonal check if(req.file) then 
    // we need to throw an error:

    if(!imageUrl){
        const error = new Error('No File Selected')
        error.statusCode = 422;
        throw error
    }
}
