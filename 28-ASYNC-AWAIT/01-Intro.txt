Intro to ASYNC / AWAIT
======================

So far in the course we've been utilzing 
promise chains for async operations, which works, 
but async / await is a much nicer way of 
dealing with asynchronous operations 

Callbacks, promises and async await all solve 
the same problem, allowing execution of the 
program to continue when fetching or reading 
data from a large file, but best practice today 
is to utilize async await. Promises and callbacks 
are still going to be used, and you'll see 
them frequently in legacy codebases, but 
for asynchronous operations today, utilzing 
async and await cleans up those sometimes very long 
promise chains .then().then().then() ... etc 

Async Await still transforms into promises behind 
the scenes, but it's much cleaner syntax
