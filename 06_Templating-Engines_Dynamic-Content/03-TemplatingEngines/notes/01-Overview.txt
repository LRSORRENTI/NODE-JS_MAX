TEMPLATING ENGINES
==================

What are templating engines and how do 
they work? 

We have a rough HTML template, we have a file 
that has some HTML, some general HTML structure 
and markup, but there are placeholders 

We also have the node / express.js content in 
the app like the products array where we added 
different books:  

shop.js [
  { title: '' },
  { title: 'Summa Theologica' },
  { title: 'The greek plays' }
]

Then we have the engine itself, which it scans the 
HTML template and replaces the placeholders with 
real HTML content, this is done on the fly by the 
templating engine on the server 

For example we could render that shop.js products 
array, the current books strings stored inside of it 
dynamically with the help of the templating engine

Then we send back a completed, placeholder's filled 
in, HTML file back to our users from the node server 

The end users will never see the placeholders from 
the template, just the dynamic content we're rendering 
into those placeholders
