LAYOUTS IN EJS
==============

In EJS we can utilize layouts to share across 
html files, inside of the ejs files we can 
add:

<%- include('includes/head.ejs') %>

^ note the '-' above and the include('filepath)
this will take the HTML code and render it where it's 
added 

This will allow us to utilize the content of 
head.ejs across our ejs files, we can do the same 
with end.ejs and navigation.ejs, because these 
will be shared across all ejs files, to create 
a cleaner structure
