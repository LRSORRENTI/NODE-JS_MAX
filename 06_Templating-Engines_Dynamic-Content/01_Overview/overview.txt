===========================
DYNAMIC CONTENT & TEMPLATES
===========================

Rendering more than just Static HTML!

Now that the core basics of node.js are set, 
let's start working more on what the user sees 
and interacts with, ultimately we want to build 
an application

So far all we've done is serve static HTML pages, and 
this is not how most applications run, more common is 
that we have data on our server / database which we 
want to dynamically render to the user 

Like for an online shop, our products are coming 
from our database / server
