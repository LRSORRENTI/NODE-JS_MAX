Assignment: Time to Practice - Templating Engines
=================================================

We learned a lot about Pug, Handlebars
 and EJS so let's see if we know how to use 
 these templating engines now!

 We need to practice using them now, as we're 
 going to be utilizing them for the remainder 
 of the course

=======
STEP 1:
=======

Create an npm project, install express.js and nodemon,
and either ejs, pug, or handlebars  

=======
STEP 2:
=======

Add two routes:

'/' holds a form that allows users to input their name 

'/users' Outputs an <ul> with the inputted name from the 
form, or error text 

Make sure you're using layouts / includes even though 
it's a small project, it facilitates re-usability
