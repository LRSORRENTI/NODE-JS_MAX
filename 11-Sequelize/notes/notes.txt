==================
What is Sequelize?
================== 

Sequelize is a third party package, to be precise 
it's a: 

Object-Relational Mapping Library or ORM, so what's 
an ORM anyway? 

Well it means it does all the heavy lifting behind 
the scenes for us, and maps it into JavaScript 
objects with convenience methods, which we 
can call to execute behind the scenes SQL code

Meaning we never have to write the SQL code ourselves, 
the ORM takes care of it for us

It works like this: 

Say we have a user object:

const user = {
    name: 'Luke',
    age: 29,
    email: 'email@email.com',
    password: 'password'
}

This object is mapped, and inside of SQL it looks 
like a table: 

users
id  name  age       email         password     
1  'Luke'  29    'email@email.com'  'password'

So when we create a new user, we simply call a 
convenience method on that JS object and our 
ORM does the rest for us, Sequelize will auto 
call the correct SQL command we need to insert

Sequelize looks like: 

const user = user.create({name: 'Luke',
                          age: 29, 
                          email: 'email@email.com',
                          password: 'password'})

So behind the scenes, user.create will turn the 
above into: 

INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Luke', 28, 'email@email.com', 'password')

Sequelize enables us to use the Models to work with 
our SQL database, we can then instantiate these models 
using instantiation methods 

We can even run queries on that as well

As well as utilize associations

Models: User Product 

Instances: const user = User.build()

Queries: User.findAll()

Associations: User.hasMany(Product)
